# K-means-Clustering-and-Deep-Learning-Project

Welcome to my K-Means Clustering and Deep Learning Project!

## Introduction
I am thrilled to share my Jupyter Notebook and the accompanying presentation deck, highlighting my work on K-Means Clustering and Deep Learning, which are integral components of the Applied Data Science and Big Data Diploma Program at We Cloud Data (WCD)! This project has provided me with a valuable opportunity to explore the intricacies of data analysis and leveraging state-of-the-art techniques. Please join me as I unveil my findings.   
## About the Project
This self-guided project centers around the application of K-means Clustering and Deep Learning techniques for data analysis. It involves utilizing a dataset obtained from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), machine learning repository. The project encompasses various stages of the Data Science workflow, including data import, exploration, feature engineering, parameter tuning, model selection, and interpretation. The main objectives are to gain hands-on practical experience using a dataset from the Retail Industry as an example, identify patterns and relationships in the data, enhance predictive power through feature engineering, and leverage unsupervised (K-means Clustering) and supervised (Deep Learning) techniques for accurate predictions.
## Sharing and Collaboration
In the spirit of fostering a constructive and collaborative learning environment, the Jupyter Notebook and the presentation deck serve as a means to not only showcase my capabilities as a data analytics professional but also to inspire others in their data analysis journey. By sharing these documents, my goal is to invite individuals to explore the techniques and strategies presented within. I wholeheartedly encourage feedback, discussions, and collaboration from visitors as their input contributes to the growth and development of all involved. Your engagement with the work presented in my repository is greatly appreciated, and I hope that you find it insightful and valuable in your own data analysis pursuits. Together, we can cultivate a vibrant community of learners and practitioners in the field of data analytics.
## Acknowledgements
I am sincerely grateful to We Cloud Data (WCD) for offering the Applied Data Science and Big Data Diploma Program, which has been instrumental in equipping me with essential knowledge in the field.
